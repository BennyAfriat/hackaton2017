# Buger Web App

A reactive, REST-ful master-detail application built using Angular 2 and angular-cli.

## Dependencies
- You must have `node v >= 4.0` and `npm v >= 3` installed (via `brew install node` or [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org/en/));

### Getting Started

There are two main parts to this application. The first is the REST API, for which we are using `json-server`. The second part is the Angular 2 application server which we will start using `ng serve`.  

To get started run the commands below.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/BennyAfriat/hackaton2017.git
$ cd hackaton2017
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200/#/items) in your browser.
